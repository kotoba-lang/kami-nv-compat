  "Regression: an axis-aligned ray must not miss geometry it passes through.

   ## The defect

   `slab-hit` divides by each direction component up front (`inv-d`), which is
   the standard fast slab test. When a component is exactly `0.0`, `inv-d` is
   infinite, and if the node's slab boundary on that axis *equals the ray origin*
   the product is `(0.0 * Infinity)` = `NaN`. Every comparison against `NaN` is
   false, so the test concludes 'miss' and the traversal skips that node **and
   its whole subtree**.

   That coincidence is not rare. A median-split BVH over a box centred on the
   origin splits at 0, and a ray fired from the origin along an axis has origin
   0 on the very axis whose slab boundary is 0. Measured before the fix: of 512
   directions from the centre of a closed 12-triangle box, **344 escaped** —
   the box leaked two thirds of its rays.

   It surfaced through occlusion queries (`kotoba.render.probe-bake` asks 'does
   this ray reach the sky'), where axis-aligned directions are common because
   low-discrepancy sequences put many samples exactly on the axes: a Hammersley
   phi of 0, pi/2, pi or 3pi/2 makes `cos` or `sin` exactly zero.

   ## Why a closed box is the right shape for this test

   A ray fired from inside a sealed solid must hit something in *every*
   direction. Any escape is a bug, with no tolerance argument available — unlike
   a grazing-angle test, where two implementations may legitimately disagree."
